# portfolio
A portfolio website made with react and vanilla css. 
The main functionality of the website is to simply display information about my experience with web development, however there is also a contact page.
Overall, the project as a whole was made with postgresql, express, react, and node, with javascript. 
If anyone would like to use this website as a template, instructions are below.

1. clone the repository
2. open in your editor

Frontend - The code is divided relatively cleanly with each page/component having isolated css
1. cd frontend
2. npm run dev

Backend - A dotenv with DATABASE_URL needs to be created

1. cd backend
2. npm i
3. npm run start
